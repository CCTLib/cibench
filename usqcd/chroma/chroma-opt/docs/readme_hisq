Chroma now includes a HISQ inverter as the action
described in:

 Highly improved staggered quarks on the lattice, with applications to charm physics.

The code has been tested against Eduardo's code on a small lattice.

The code has now been integrated into the Chroma world view,
so that either the HISQ or ASQTAD action can be selected at
run time. See: chroma/tests/spectrum_s/

The correction to the Naik term, epsilon (equation 24 in the above paper) is NOT
automatically included, so must be loaded from the input file.
This correction will (maybe) be computed in perturbation theory
one day.

       <FermionAction>
          <FermAct>HISQ</FermAct>
          <Mass>0.1</Mass>
<u0>1.0</u0>
<epsilon>-0.21</epsilon>
          <FermState>
            <Name>SIMPLE_FERM_STATE</Name>
            <FermionBC>
              <FermBC>SIMPLE_FERMBC</FermBC>
              <boundary>1 1 1 1</boundary>
            </FermionBC>
          </FermState>
        </FermionAction>


No doubt having epsilon as a input parameter will cause some 
confusion.


There is an exampl of using HISQ in:
