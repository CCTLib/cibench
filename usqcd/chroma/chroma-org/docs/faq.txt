Chroma FAQ

Tue Jan 20 12:02:27 GMT 2004

1) Where is the main web page for Chroma?
   http://www.jlab.org/~edwards/chroma/


2)  How do I add a new library routine to Chroma?

    The name of the application and its header should be added
    to the appropriate macro in lib/Makefile.am.
    Typing "make" should then compile the new routine
    into the libraries.

    The compile system is clever enough to know
    that it has to rerun the automake/autoconf 
    system. If you have out of date versions 
    of these programs on your system then this will fail.
    You then have to install your own versions of automake/autoconf
    and put them at the top of your path.

3) Is there a mailing list for Chroma and QDP++?

   Yes:
   http://forge.nesc.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/qcd-measure-qdp++


4) Chroma doesn't have application XYZ. What should I do?

   First you should check in the SZIN library. 
   (http://www.jlab.org/~edwards/szin/). If the 
   application exists there, you can use the
   recode utility (http://www.jlab.org/~edwards/lattice_cvs.html).

   The code produced by recode is not perfect
   QDP++/Chrma code, however it is a good starting point.
