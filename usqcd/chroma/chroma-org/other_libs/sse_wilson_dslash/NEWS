21/11/07: Balint Joo - Some tweaking. Simplifying the site loops for single precision brought marked
                       improvement both on my CoreDuo Laptop and on AMD Barcelona. On qcdeval-01 the 
	               single node (no comms) dslash ran with 3.77Gflops, and the the 3d dslash with 3.4Gflops.
		       Code also builds with intel compiler, but apparently not with the pathscale compiler.
	               Pathscale generated code does not appear to pass regression and appears slow (NaNs?)
		       Intel generated code seems slower than GNU, but can't be sure as it ran on a slower
	               system. Time to leave this now and do some tests in Parallel.

12/9/07: Balint Joo - Initial revision. Passes regressions in scalar, scalar-double, single, single-double
