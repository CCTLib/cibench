02/06/2015 -- Balint Joo 
	Updated submodules, pulled in HDF5 fixes (Thorsten Kurth)
        Added  Blue Gene Thread binding (orig. developed in QPhiX by Diptorup Deb)


06/02/2014 -- Frank Winter and Robert Edwards
        Version 1.44.0: Added new OSubLattice  type that can be declared. This allows objects
	to be allocated according to a subset.
	Removed QCDOC-isms.

03/13/2014 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.43.0: Added new global functions. 

07/04/2012 -- Balint Joo
        Version 1.42.0: New funtionality allowing for QIO to write from multiple
        IO nodes.

06/26/2012 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.41.0: Changed implementation of MapObjectDisk to
        use tr1::unordered_map. Now, should be no more instances of
        std::map in qdp++ that requires the user to supply some form
        of operator< for key comparisons.
  
06/25/2012 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.40.1: Added xml reads/writes of std::list as well as
        specializatiions for std::vector.
   
06/06/2012 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.40.0: Added in new tr1::unordered_map class. Several fixes
        in string broadcasts.

09/26/2011 -- Balint Joo
        Version 1.39.0: Changed OpenMP dispatch methods.

11/02/2010 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.38.3: Added a new BinaryReaderWriter class and structure
        that supports both reading and writing of objects. 
        Overhauled MapObject interface to use this new structure. Removed
        the previous locking mechanisms as they are now unneeded. This all
        simplifies the MapObject interface. Can now close and reopen a 
        MapObjectDisk file and continue insertions.
        Did a bunch of house cleaning - removed some obsolete code and stuff
        not actually used.

11/02/2010 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.37.3: Added a close function in MapObjectDisk. Some slight
        change of diagnostic output in multiNd.

11/01/2010 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.37.2: Added some IO support for multiNd.

10/10/2010 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.37.1: Some more MapObject variants. Added another RNG just
        for variety.

10/07/2010 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.37.0: Added MapObject and MapObjectDisk.

03/08/2010 -- Balint Joo
        Version 1.36.2: Merged in devel branch, with threaded sumMulti

02/11/2010 -- Balint Joo
	Version 1.36.1: Changed a template trait so that it would become palatable to the intel compiler

02/07/2010 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.36.0: Changed interface of DB wrappers to use new "const" version
        within FILEDB get/insert.

11/06/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.35.0: Added new seek functions to BinaryReader/Writer.

11/06/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.34.1: Fixes in xpath_reader to support bools under gcc-4.4

10/16/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.34.0: Added a Dirac-Pauli gamma matrix basis.

10/13/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.33.1: Changes to support and odd number of threads. Small changes in
        DB wrappers.

09/11/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.33.0: Added new qdp functions colorCrossProduct and colorVectorContract.
        Some important bug fixes in filedb. Added some new functions to those classes.
        Some other small changes in xpath reader. Reintroduced stub and implementation
        functions for filedb wrappers.

04/22/2009 -- Balint Joo
	Version 1.32.1 
	  Fixed a mistake in the filedb/filehash makefile.am  that
	stopped this from building...


03/17/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.32.0: Added back in functionality to turn on/off the "filedb" DB support.
        By default it is on, but a  "--disable-filedb" can turn it off. QDP++ leaves
        a stub version of the DB routines. The main reason to disable filedb is if a
        posix thread library is not available, as on a BG/L. 

03/16/2009 -- Balint Joo
	Version 1.31.1: Maintainance:
	  - Fixed OpenMP Bug that plagued OpenMP threaded reductions
          - Added OpenMP innerProduct() for LatticeFermions
	  - Disabled spinProjection Optimizations -- these clash in a 'multi precision' build.
	     put these on a toFix list
	Remaining FIXMEs:
	   - Generic BLAS etc is still in 'floating' type. Specialize to Single/Double
	   - Threaded Complex BLAS in Single and Double Prec SSE please for BiCGStab
	   - BlueGene development: 
		xlC building
	        threading BAGEL QDP wrappers
	        generate single and double precision BAGEL libraries?

03/05/2009 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.31.1: Important bug fix in the DB routines  filedb - fixed a 
        free of a memory page. Was causing the code to crash. 

03/04/2009 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.31.0: Ripped out ffdb-lite. Switched to filedb. No longer any Berkeley DB
        dependencies.

03/04/2009 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.30.1: Balint put threading in rest of way, including norm2. Various other
        fixes. Robert switched DB support ffdb-lite to slightly different calling interface 
        to fix support for page sizes, etc. This is the last of ffdb-lite. Will be removed.
        Other changes in qio for BG/P.

01/27/2009 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.30.0: First DB implementations. First threading version. Not fully certified.
        Support subset records in qio.

12-22-2008 -- Balint Joo
	Added threading support courtesy of EPCC. Tested that threading code with threads disabled: 
	 -- does not break cb2, cb3d, sse2/generic, single-double builds (scalar)
	Threading code with threads enabled has causes some SEGFAULTS in
	QDP++ tests. However, with cb2, chroma regressions passed. Only
	failures were in the new all-to-all code

Total Failures were:
i)		chroma           RUN_FAIL    prec_clover.eigcg.candidate.xml
 NOTE: Easily understood, I didn't compile BLAS etc for EigCG support...

ii)  chroma           RUN_FAIL    colorvec_matelem.candidate.xml
iii) make_meson_ops   FAIL (compile)  make_meson_ops.candidate.xml
iv)  make_baryon_ops  FAIL (compile)  make_baryon_ops.candidate.xml

These are not yet understood
-
08/02/2008 -- Balint Joo
        Version 1.28.0: SSE3 and 3dnow support. Added new double prec blas and linalg routines. New
        test jig support.

05/22/2008 -- Robert Edwards
        Version 1.27.0: Improved SSE for global sums. Fixed some ifdef guard-isms. Now have some significant
        amount of SSE BLAS routines.

05/14/2008 -- Balint Joo
        Various tweaks:  
            - some explicit char * casting to get rid of deprecated feature warnings from newer gcc compilers
	    - included <cstring> <cstdlib> in a few places to get at memcpy, memcmp and memset - this broke some 
              really new gcc compilers
	    - Got rid of complicated logic to cope with gnu/non gnu builds for SSE in scalarsite_sse. Now if you 
	      --enable-sse or --enable-sse2 you'll get the SSE code, whether you want it or not. Pretty much all 
              the assembler is now done with compiler intrinsics, so as long as your compiler can eat those you 
	      should be OK. Intel is supposed to be able to eat them as is pathscale, but I haven't tested these
	      recently.

05/02/2008 -- Version 1.26.0 -- Balint Joo
        Minor tweaks:
          - exposed some layout functions to facilitate Level 3 related issues.
	  - added 'cb3d' layout with time running fastest (but not vectorized on)
	  - added Hypercubic writes to QDPFileWriter to write QIO sources
	  - cleaned up QDPFileReader so it can read QIO sources (and not corrupt anything outside the hypercube)
	  - Added readOLattie_parallel, writeOLattice_parallel to do parallel writing on QCDOC
            - NB This feature is exposed in all parscalar_specific targets as it appears to have no real QCDOC
	      specific bits - just deals with FILE*-s etc.

08/30/2007 -- Balint Joo
        Removed SSE Inlines from scalarsite_sse. Replaced with calls to libintrin (made from the same NASM source but with intrinsics). 3rd party track imported libintrin. It gets checked out with the qdp++ source automatically and --enable-sse2 is needed to configure it. I disabled automatic turning on of the -msse and -msse2 flags since they can break some compilers. Set these using your own CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS. 

08/30/2007 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.24.6: Added some diagnostic output code in c-lime & qio.

08/23/2007 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.24.5: Mainly this tags a working version of QIO for mesh
        machines. Also, some cleanups by Balint in SSE asm codes.

08/14/2007 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.24.4: Changes to QIO to support BinaryBufferWriter used in QDPQIO
        calls. Basically, the contents of BinaryBufferWriter lives only on the 
        primary node, so QIO had to be changed to support "global data" only on
        the primary node and only char datatypes.

08/13/2007 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.24.3: Bug fix. The reorganized BinaryReader/Writer were failing
        in parallel mode. This is now fixed. There are still some issues/errors
        with using BinaryBufferWriter within QIO in a parscalar build. However,
        BinaryFileReader/Writer plus NERSC and SZIN IO are fine.

07/17/2007 -- Balint Joo
	Version 1.24.2: Trawled through to eliminate most compiler
	warnings with -Wall in the QDP++ and XPathReader libs. Still
	some warnings remain in QIO.

06/12/2007 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.24.1: Added "const" to some member funcs in XMLBufferWriter.
        Fixed a missing #endif.

06/10/2007 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.24.0: Reorganized BinaryReader/Writer and TextReader. Now,
        these classes are abstract classes (just like XMLWriter) for 
        BinaryBufferReader/Writer and BinaryFileReader/Writer . Also, removed
        the old QDP_BEGIN/END_NAMESPACE macro and now simply use "namespace QDP".
	Added string initialization to XMLBufferWriter.

03/14/2007 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.23.0: Added new functions globalMax and globalMin.

03/05/2007 -- Balint Joo
 ---    Version 1.22.1 
	For release.....

02/27/2007

	Version 1.22.0

	Major surgery. Unordered/Unordered Sets, Ordered/UnorderedSubsets are gone.
	Only Sets and Subsets remain. Trawled through evaluates and recoded with
	if( s.hasOrderedSubset() ) {   } else {  } 
	constructs (This speeded up unordered subsets. Checked tests and chroma 
	regressions pass with generic, sse and bagel_qdp in both cb2 and lexico layouts.

        NB: scalarsite_qcdoc needs tested on an actual QCDOC (BEWARE!!!!)


02/16/2007 -- Balint Joo
        Version 1.21.9
	
	Added an Unordered subset (rb3) for 3d checkerboarding - This subset is currently
	unordered in all builds
 
02/09/2006 -- Balint Joo
	Version 1.21.8
	Propagated spin/projection and reconstruction hooks to the SSE Single Prec branch.
	Duplicated qdp_primvector code into qdp_primspinvector so that qdp_primpspinvector
	is no longer a qdp_primvector. This way I can have spin vectors 16 byte aligned
	without necessarily having to have all vectors 16 bye aligned. Wrote SSE versions
	of spin project and recon inlines. Sadly even with all these the Chroma Dslash
	only runs at about 900Mflops on a scalar version of my laptop. Should probably
	rewrite with inline assembler so I have better control of registers than the compiler

02/06/2007 -- Balint Joo
	Version 1.21.7: Added various generic spin projection and recon 
        optimizations and hooks, which hopefully will be useful for
	temporal preconditioning in chroma

11/21/2006 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.21.6: Fix zero-length arrays in read/write xml.

09/26/2006 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.21.2: Small code cleanup of duplicate sse opts.

09/26/2006 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.21.1: New SSE optimizations  a*x+b*y  like ops (vaxpby3).

09/24/2006 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.21.0: New SSE optimizations for traceSpin(outerProduct()), LatColMat=M*M
        and adj variants including  adjMultiplyAdj().

07/17/2006 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.20.9: Changed precision output in xml and stdio. 
        Now, singles get 7 digits and doubles get 15 digits.

07/11/2006 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.20.8: Changes/fixes to SSE version of norm2(). Now do local on
        node sum in double prec. instead of single.

06/21/2006 -- Balint Joo

	Version 1.20.7: Compilation fixes for new platforms. Fixes in multi3d.

01/05/2006 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.18.3: Patches in QIO to support reading ancient propagators.
        Added flexible precision reading of QIO files. Some more ILDG support.

12/22/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.18.2: Changes to support gcc4 and intel compiler.

11/17/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.18.1: Typos fixed in multi3d. Fixed QIO isms.

11/17/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.18.0: New seed operatations. Eliminated default PSeed traits.
        Added some missing functions  floor, ceil, cosh, tanh, sinh.

11/16/2005 -- Balint Joo

	Version 1.17.2: New QIO and QDP++ support for ILDG.

11/04/2005 -- Robert Edwards

10/16/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.16.3: Added memory map dump in Olattice alloc failure.

10/16/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.16.2: Moved StopWatch inline functions to new lib file. 
        Moved inline functions in xpath_reader/basic_xpath_reader down into
        lib file.

10/12/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.16.1: Changed QDPFileReader/Writer to shutdown if errors
        upon opening file for reading/writing.

09/16/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.16.0: Added QDP_DEBUG_MEMORY control.

09/03/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.15.4: Added mem map to QCDOC allocator. Moved code to lib file.

08/26/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.15.3: Updated NERSC header parsing to accomodate funky headers.

08/23/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.15.2: Checksums, plaq and link checks in NERSC gauge reader/writer.

08/20/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.15.1: Added checks in XML open routines. Changes in
        QIO to support PARTFILE.

07/26/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.15.0: Checksums added to binary reader and writer.

07/20/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.14.5: Added transposeColor

07/20/2005 -- Balint Joo

	Version 1.14.4
	Various fixes:
	   -- memory manager singletons are now created with no destroy
	      policy. This fixes bug reported by CraigMcNeile in staggered
	      code where the static phases containing memory allocated by the
	      memory manager were destroyed after the memory manager causing
	      a dead reference exception

	   -- Fixed the PETE/Tools code so that it compiles. diff of 
	      QDPOperators.h before and after fix differs only in 
	      indentation. Rock on PETE!

	   -- Added transposeSpin function to QDPOperators.h 
	      and defined in qdp_primscalar.h qdp_primmatrix.h and 
	      most importantly in qdp_primspinmat.h. Incorrect
	      invocations eg transposeSpin(ColorMatrix) fail to compile.
	      Correct invocations work. transposeSpin(SpinMatrix) and 
	      transposeSpin(Propagator) were tested. Simple test code
	      t_transpose_spin added to examples directory -- now
	      need to move transpose spin functionality to appropriate
	      places in chroma.

07/18/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.14.3. Updated lib/Makefile.am to include new paths
        down inside c-lime. This sub-release reflects new changes in
        QIO and C-LIME.

07/12/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.14.2. Bug fix in qdp_primmatrix. Fixed  "PScalar - PMatrix". 
        Thanks to Patrick Varilly for finding this.
        Incorporated new changes for file reading/writing support within QIO.

06/28/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.14.1. Allocator pushed to a cc file instead of inlined. Saves on
        compilation.

	Version 1.12.1. Changes to support QIO 2 interface.

03/21/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.12.0. New/improved generic and SSE opts for chiralProject.
        Improved sumMulti and added a sumMulti(multi1d<>) variant.

02/10/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.8. Bug fix again in qdp_multi1d.h . Now have moved 
        back to the old tried-and-true version if multiXd but added a few
        new functions.

02/03/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.7. Removed member func. template params in
        multi1,2,Nd<T>. 

01/28/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.6. Further fixes to multi1d,

01/28/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.5. Further changes to qdp_io.h to put Remote IO
        under REMOTE_USE_QIO control.

01/24/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.4. Zbigniew has changed all qdp, qio, c-lime config.h 
        to use char* for package names so they actually are useable.

01/24/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.3. Changed XMLFileWriter support. Now, explicitly
        use ofstream in case of not USE_REMOTE_QIO. Make 
        XMLFileWriter::is_open() check if QDP is (still) initialized
        to avoid crashes on destructor calls.

01/22/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.2. QCDOC fixes. Changed xmlreader.print functions to 
        broadcast their strings.

01/18/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.1. Maintenance changes within QIO and other little
        things.

11/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.0. Removed all Namelist usage and files. Switched all regression
        to XML. Modified Makefiles to now pass   make distcheck

11/02/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.10.6. More QIO fiddling.

10/29/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.10.5. Changed QIO to (again) use optimized QMP_gigE calls

10/29/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.10.4. Bug fix. Fix free'ing of msghandles in parscalar
        and parscalarvec per the new QMP-2 specification.

10/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.10.3. Added staggered propagator typedefs.

10/18/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.10.2. Improvements within QIO.

09/10/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.10.1. Added obsolete calling conventions of QDPFile{Reader,Writer}.
        Fixed QIO string usage.

09/07/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.10.0. Parallel version now exclusively uses QMP-2 . QMP-1.X is
        not supported. Now one must specify the arch on configure. QIO support is
        now 1.0. So, the default checkouts of QMP and QIO are consistent with QDP++.

08/18/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.9.4. More little fixes to really really get the
        "vec" versions work again. 

08/10/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.9.3. Lots of cleanups. The "vec" versions work again. Some
        bug fixes. Fleshed out missing outerProduct.

07/28/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.9.2. Added switch to qdp++-config to tell about QMP_HOME.

07/28/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.9.1. Changed RNG generation so that a lattice wide
        fill of rngs will also throw away an additional rng. This
        dirty trick helps to avoid correlations induced from generating
        large powers of 2 of rngs.

07/26/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.9.0. Added profiling capability at configure with  --enable-profiling.
        Changed/broke old memory layout by removing the PScalar level for PDWVector
	which has been removed.

07/12/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.8.6. Small tweaks before next minor release.

05/23/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.8.5. Added complete SciDAC mandated types.

02/10/2003 -- George Fleming:

        Totally reworked the way QDP gets information about how to compile
        and link against QMP (if needed for parscalar).  INSTALL and README
        now are wrong and I need to update them.

01/29/2003 -- Robert Edwards:

        The single box (scalar) and parallel (parscalar) versions
        work. The old compile-time volume configuration removed. The
        user can now choose at run-time the lattice size.


12/13/2002 -- Balint Joo: 

	Switched to George Fleming style autoconf system (See INSTALL)
	examples now not automatically built (make check builds them)

	Added Robert's parscalar_specific.h of 12/12/2002
	Parscalar targets now compile

	Added QDP::QDP_init() and QDP_finalize() to call QMP_init_msg_passing 
	from, with command line arguments
