# Compiler definitions
# NOTE: a gcc **version 2*** is required. The reason is because I'm allowing
# string literals to run over a line. This is now not allowed in the standard.
# The problem is not due to PETE, but instead me (RGE) wanting to put in multi-line
# comments into the resulting QDPOperators.h file. Otherwise, there is no restriction
# on the compiler. 
# NOTE: this compiler restriction is ***ONLY*** to generate the .h file - a
# very few time affair.
