QIO package

int types:
-- fix headers so that public ones do not need or include fixed integer
   types so we can safely redefine these if necessary.

DML wish list
-- Strip mine or vectorize the multifile in/out so groups
   of contiguous data can be "put" or "get" in one call.

Additions needed
-- stdin, stdout, stderr: Global broadcast scanf and printf 
-- Pure XML I/O  (same as global string scanf or printf?)
