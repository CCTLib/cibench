This directory contains the MakeOperators tool that generates
operators and functions that return expression template objects.
See the man page in html/makeoperators.html for a description
of the tool produced here.

The makefile in this directory has several targets:

make default:
  produces the MakeOperators tool.

make peteheaders:
  makes the file OperatorTags.h found in src/PETE.  To install it
  there type 'make installheaders'.

make newpeteops:
  makes the file PeteOps.cpp in the current directory.

The last target needs a little explaining.  PETE comes with 45
built-in operators, defined in PeteOps.in.  These could be included
by saying 'MakeOperators --operators PeteOps.in', but that would
force users to provide the correct path to PeteOps.in or make a
local copy.  We decided, therefore, to build these operators into
the executable, so that users wouldn't have to explicitly include
the file PeteOps.in.  The data for these operators is in PeteOps.cpp.
To avoid maintaining duplicate versions of the same data, MakeOperators
can be used to build PeteOps.cpp from PeteOps.in.  Note that users
can always provide their own input file for operator definitions,
but if you wanted to permanently extend the set of PETE's built-in
operators, you should add the operators to PeteOps.in, use
'make newpeteops' to build PeteOps.cpp, and then re-build
MakeOperators.
