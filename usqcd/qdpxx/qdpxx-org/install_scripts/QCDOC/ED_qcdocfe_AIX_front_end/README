  If we have the bagel_qdp library, we can now use it.
  Substitute the build_all.sh and build_functions.sh scripts
  with build_all_bagel_qdp.sh and build_functions_bagel_qdp.sh 

###

To compile on the QCDOC front end:

i) Compile Libxml (this is not quite turnkey since the getcwd 
                   syscall seems to have disappeared)

ii) Locate a QMP2 capable QOS (harder than you may think)

iii) Edit the setup.sh script so that you wire in the right values
for the CROSSCOMPILE_TOOLS directory (something like 
/qcdoc/sfw/packages/v1.1/local/bin)

Then edit the QOS and LIBXML directories

iv) In the toplevel directory of your build 
	source setup.sh
	
v) Then run configure_qdp++_ddr.sh

vi) gmake; gmake install
