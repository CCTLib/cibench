03/06/2015 -- James Osborn

        Version 2.4.2 - when opening for write, only one node creates file.

05/04/2014 -- Carleton DeTar

        Version 2.4.1 - Support color and color/spin tags in source record XML.
        Thus the caller may require XML reparsing for backward compatibility.

04/23/2014 -- James Osborn

        Version 2.4.0 - export CC to c-lime if not already set,
	added barrier after writing field, added some diagnostic output.

07/28/2011 -- James Osborn

        Version 2.3.9 - Allowed singlefile format to use parallel I/O with
                        only a subset of the nodes doing I/O.

03/03/2009 -- James Osborn

        Version 2.3.8 - Made it so that the "clear to send" messages are still
        sent when HAVE_BGL is defined.

11/05/2008 -- Carleton DeTar

        Version 2.3.7 corrects a bug that affected splitting
        of subset records.  It also now supports the XML empty
        tag </tag>.

06/25/2008 -- Carleton DeTar

        Version 2.3.6 corrects a memory corruption bug in the single-processor
        file splitting and flattening utility that caused an occasional 
        seg fault in libc/malloc.

05/25/2008 -- Carleton DeTar

        Version 2.3.5 Corrects the record tag for the USQCD propagator
        records, increases the size limit for the record XML,
        adds some file conversion utilities, and fixes some minor bugs.

02/24/2008 -- Carleton DeTar

        Version 2.3.4 Corrected file splitting/joining for hypercube records.

02/05/2008 -- Carleton DeTar

        Version 2.3.3 Added support for USQCD staggered propagator format

08/30/2007 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 2.3.2 Added some more diagnostic output.

08/23/2007 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 2.3.1 Added a hack to allow Bluegenes to use switch mode
        in DML_route_bytes when QMP is put into mesh mode.

08/21/2007 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 2.3.0 Added --enable-dml-output-buffering which turns on the
        DML_partition_out routine that buffers sites to send to master-io-node.
        Changed --enable-slow-route to --enable-fast-route. Now, by default the
        slow but safe code is used and the enable option turns on the faster
        but problematic code. These two changes now allow a build out-of-the-box
        to work on JLab grid machines plus potentially other grid machines as
        well, as well as QMP/MPI in mesh mode.

08/14/2007 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 2.2.1 Patched byterevn and QIO_write. The latter now supports
        global data living on only the master_io_node.

06/16/2007 -- Carleton DeTar

        Version 2.2.0 Added support for USQCD propagator file formats.  
                      Added hypercube record type.  (Breaks previous API.)
                      Add support for user-defined I/O nodes. (Breaks 
                      previous API.)
                      Rearranged QIO_info*.c and qioxml*.h for clarity.
                      Updated documentation.

05/13/2007 -- Carleton DeTar

        Version 2.1.9 Added support for dache/dcap.  Added file splitting for 
                      I/O partitions.  Add Enno Scholz's support for
                      constructing and parsing USQCD XML for lattice files.

02/12/2007 -- James Osborn

        Version 2.1.8 Eliminated compiler warnings and now save configure
                      options in qio-config.

11/24/2006 -- Carleton DeTar

        Version 2.1.7 Introduced buffered message passing for serial writes.

05/21/2006 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 2.1.6. Compilation bug fixes.

03/24/2006 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 2.1.5. Tagged Carleton's fix in QIO_open_write.c (grrhh).

05/29/2005 -- James Osborn

	Version 2.0.3. Changed the num_sites functions to return int instead
	of size_t, since this is what QDP will support.  Also minor cleanups
	and fixes.

05/18/2005 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 2.0.2. Small cleanups in Makefile.am's - removed VPATH

01/07/2005 -- Carleton DeTar

	Version 1.1.5. Change LIME file byte counter types to off_t and
	change QIO/LRL to conform. Update QIO documentation. 
        A little housekeeping.

11/30/2004 -- James Osborn

	Version 1.1.0. Attempt to fix int types on QCDOC.

11/01/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.beta2. Small fixes in compilation.

11/01/2004 -- Carleton Detar

	Version 1.1.beta1. Added host-to-node conversion implementation
        and interface.

10/29/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.0.beta5. Turned back on DML_route_bytes. This allows
        optimized QMP calls on gigE boxes.

10/18/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.0.beta4. Improvements on autoconf-isms.

08/03/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.0.beta3. Added back in scalar and parscalar builds.
        Default is to always build for parallel environment requiring
        QMP.

08/01/2004 -- Carleton DeTar

        Version 1.0 supports partitioned I/O.
        Parallel I/O capability has been abandoned.
        Open write "mode" has been abandoned.
        Added some examples.
        Requires QMP-2.0

05/11/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 0.9.5. Last minor changes. Will split off c-lime to
        its own module.

03/19/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 0.9.4. Added back in tests for QMP_route to supplant
        the native/correct DML_grid_route() IFF QMP_route is available.

03/11/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 0.9.3. Bug fixes in multifile lime headers.

03/07/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 0.9.2. Cleanups. Changed XML_string to QIO_String.

02/28/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 0.9.1. Fixed some mem leaks with record_info.
        Config file now fully autoconf-iscated.

02/27/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 0.9.0. Functionality extended to SINGLEFILE/MULTIFILE.
        The PARALLEL file-system version not implemented yet. Various
        bug fixes and code improvements. Tested/working on large 
        cluster sizes.

11/01/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 0.8.1. Changed cpp BIG_ENDIAN to QIO_BIG_ENDIAN to avoid name 
        collisions under linux.
