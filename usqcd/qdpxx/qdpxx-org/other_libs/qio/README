Building the QIO package also builds LIME.  

The QIO package requires the QMP package, which must be built and
installed first.

If you like to build QIO in a separate, sibling build directory,
create the build directory and then from that directory, run (for
example)

../qio-1.1.6/configure \
     --prefix=$HOME/scidac/qio \
     CC=gcc \
     CFLAGS="-O3" \
     --with-qmp=$HOME/scidac/qmp \
     --disable-qmp-route
