LIME may be built as a separate package.

If you like to build it in a separate, sibling build directory,
create the build directory and then from that directory, run (for
example)

../lime-1.1/configure --prefix=$LIMEPREFIX CC=gcc CFLAGS=-O3
make
make install

where LIMEPREFIX is the installation directory.


The utilities are in the examples directory.  To build them, run

   make check
